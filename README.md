# To Do List built with React/Redux ✔️

## Project Description

I was tasked with building a simple to do list whilst implementing the Redux library to learn how Redux and reducers operate. I created different reducers to handle the functionality of the list whilst letting the Redux store handle the state.

The ToDo list allows users to add or delete tasks, and uses the input bar to also update tasks. The tasks can also be marked as completed.
